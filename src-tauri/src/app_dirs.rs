//! Centralized application data directory and PID lock file management.
//!
//! All code that needs `~/.myagents/` SHOULD use [`myagents_data_dir()`] instead of
//! hardcoding the path. This enables future dev/prod isolation (separate data dirs
//! for debug vs release builds) with a single change to this module.
//!
//! ## PID Lock File
//!
//! `~/.myagents/app.lock` contains the PID of the running MyAgents instance.
//! - Written by [`acquire_lock()`] during app startup (after single-instance check).
//! - Read by build scripts (`build_dev.sh`, `start_dev.sh`) to precisely kill the
//!   running instance before starting a new one.
//! - Removed by [`release_lock()`] on graceful exit.
//!
//! The **return value** of [`acquire_lock`] is also used by [`crate::sidecar::
//! cleanup_stale_sidecars`] to decide whether to scan for orphaned child
//! processes: on a truly fresh launch ([`LockAcquireResult::FreshLaunch`])
//! there cannot be any orphans, so the scan is skipped — this alone saves
//! 5–15 seconds on first launch under Windows Defender.
